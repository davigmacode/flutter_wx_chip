Revamp the Flutter Chips to empower developers with more intuitive and streamlined styling and theming capabilities. This will eliminate platform-specific limitations, allowing for a truly cross-platform design experience. By decoupling the chip's appearance from the underlying platform, developers gain greater control over the chip's look and feel, making it easier to tailor it to their specific design requirements and brand identity.
